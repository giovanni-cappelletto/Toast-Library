# Toast.js Library 
In this project I tried to create a copy of [React-Toastify Libray](https://fkhadra.github.io/react-toastify/introduction/), after I've watched the same project in the video of [Web Dev Simplified](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhpbzPMCKDc).

The project works enough well, even though there are some bugs. 
In the future I will try to recreate this in a better way. 

## Disclaimer
This was my first time trying to implement OOP, so if you have any suggestion write it to me!
